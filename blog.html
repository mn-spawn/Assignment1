            <h1>Assignment 1 - 10/09</h1>
            <p> For this assignment I wanted to dust off some of the basics that I had covered over the summer.
                I wrote out the HTML "frame" and then dove into CSS. It took me a little bit to get back into the flow of things
                but pretty soon I felt comfortable changing colors and fonts and putting in pictures and manipulating those.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge I faced was remembering specific syntax. I hadn't used CSS for a little bit and so the invicible
                rules and syntax had completely slipped my mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main resource to approach that was just to keep W3 school's CSS tutorial open and click to double check my syntax
                when it wasn't working out quite how I wanted it to. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I got a little bit more practice using selecotrs on this assignment which was exciting :).

            <h1>Assignment 2 - 10/20</h1>
            <p> 
                For assignment 1 I had already experimented a little bit with CSS so I didn't feel too challenged by this Assignment. 
                For assignment 2 I was really hoping to solidify my knowledge of CSS because everything I alredy knew was from tutorials
                that I watched on an as-needed basis. Basically, when I had a problem I "googled" the solution.
                I feel that this assignment definietely tested the basics and the lectures helped me get a concrete
                base to stand on.
                <br>
                <br>
                 That isn't to say that I didn't run into challenges. Just as I suspected I had a good hold on things like borders
                 and colors but struggled with organizing the layout. The biggest issue I faced was trying to get the posts to display
                 horizontally but move down vertically when I sized the window down. I was stuck with one long row of horizontal posts
                 which was not what I wanted. Looking back, I absolutely appreciate the stress that this assignment placed on layout because
                 it absolutely was the weakest link in my CSS understanding.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The resources I used were pretty similar to assignment 1's. I used W3 to some degree with the basic stuff. However, this assignment
                 I definietely did my fair shaire of stack-overflow searching just trying to find a way to make sense of the layout requirements that I
                 was struggling with.
