            <h1>Assignment 1 - 10/09</h1>
            <p> For this assignment I wanted to dust off some of the basics that I had covered over the summer.
                I wrote out the HTML "frame" and then dove into CSS. It took me a little bit to get back into the flow of things
                but pretty soon I felt comfortable changing colors and fonts and putting in pictures and manipulating those.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge I faced was remembering specific syntax. I hadn't used CSS for a little bit and so the invicible
                rules and syntax had completely slipped my mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main resource to approach that was just to keep W3 school's CSS tutorial open and click to double check my syntax
                when it wasn't working out quite how I wanted it to. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I got a little bit more practice using selecotrs on this assignment which was exciting :).

            <p> 
                I had a lot of fun with this assignment and most of it went by with ease. I have been
                experimenting a lot with React.js recently so this assignment fel like I was really strengthening 
                the foundational js that React builds off of. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge that I went up against was removing things and adding them back into the DOM.
                I misread the original instructions and thought we could just hide and unhide them but on my double check
                pass I read it correctly. I had most of the foundational code (just replaced add.('hidden with .remove'))                
                but had to work out how was going to maintain the order and add deleted elements back in. That definetely took
                a bit to figure out.
                <br>
                <br>
                The two main things I had to google were the onDOMContentLoad event listener argument. This was used to keep a record
                of posts I would have to add back in later. I also had to google the syntax to loop through the post elements to check them
                against the filtering requirements. My main help as always was StackOverflow.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I really learned the in's and out's of basic JavaScript and felt like I got to experiment with a lot of different aspects
                of JS. I even got to get into some string formatting to make my extra credit function look extra nice!
                The DOM is also an area of webdev that's a lot clearer to me now, so that is 100% an appreciated skill I got
                to take away from this assignment as well.
