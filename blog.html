            <h1>Assignment 1 - 10/09</h1>
            <p> For this assignment I wanted to dust off some of the basics that I had covered over the summer.
                I wrote out the HTML "frame" and then dove into CSS. It took me a little bit to get back into the flow of things
                but pretty soon I felt comfortable changing colors and fonts and putting in pictures and manipulating those.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge I faced was remembering specific syntax. I hadn't used CSS for a little bit and so the invicible
                rules and syntax had completely slipped my mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main resource to approach that was just to keep W3 school's CSS tutorial open and click to double check my syntax
                when it wasn't working out quite how I wanted it to. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I got a little bit more practice using selecotrs on this assignment which was exciting :).
