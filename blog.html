            <h1>Assignment 1 - 10/09</h1>
            <p> For this assignment I wanted to dust off some of the basics that I had covered over the summer.
                I wrote out the HTML "frame" and then dove into CSS. It took me a little bit to get back into the flow of things
                but pretty soon I felt comfortable changing colors and fonts and putting in pictures and manipulating those.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge I faced was remembering specific syntax. I hadn't used CSS for a little bit and so the invicible
                rules and syntax had completely slipped my mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main resource to approach that was just to keep W3 school's CSS tutorial open and click to double check my syntax
                when it wasn't working out quite how I wanted it to. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I got a little bit more practice using selecotrs on this assignment which was exciting :).

            <h1>Assignment 2 - 10/20</h1>
            <p>
                    For assignment 1 I had already experimented a little bit with CSS so I didn't feel too challenged by this Assignment. 
                    For assignment 2 I was really hoping to solidify my knowledge of CSS because everything I alredy knew was from tutorials
                    that I watched on an as-needed basis. Basically, when I had a problem I "googled" the solution.
                    I feel that this assignment definietely tested the basics and the lectures helped me get a concrete
                    base to stand on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That isn't to say that I didn't run into challenges. Just as I suspected I had a good hold on things like borders
                    and colors but struggled with organizing the layout. The biggest issue I faced was trying to get the posts to display
                    horizontally but move down vertically when I sized the window down. I was stuck with one long row of horizontal posts
                    which was not what I wanted. Looking back, I absolutely appreciate the stress that this assignment placed on layout because
                    it absolutely was the weakest link in my CSS understanding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The resources I used were pretty similar to assignment 1's. I used W3 to some degree with the basic stuff. However, this assignment
                    I definietely did my fair shaire of stack-overflow searching just trying to find a way to make sense of the layout requirements that I
                    was struggling with.

            <h1>Assignment 3 - 11/04</h1>
            <p> 
                I had a lot of fun with this assignment and most of it went by with ease. I have been
                experimenting a lot with React.js recently so this assignment fel like I was really strengthening 
                the foundational js that React builds off of. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The main challenge that I went up against was removing things and adding them back into the DOM.
                I misread the original instructions and thought we could just hide and unhide them but on my double check
                pass I read it correctly. I had most of the foundational code (just replaced add.('hidden with .remove'))                
                but had to work out how was going to maintain the order and add deleted elements back in. That definetely took
                a bit to figure out.
                <br>
                <br>
                The two main things I had to google were the onDOMContentLoad event listener argument. This was used to keep a record
                of posts I would have to add back in later. I also had to google the syntax to loop through the post elements to check them
                against the filtering requirements. My main help as always was StackOverflow.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, I really learned the in's and out's of basic JavaScript and felt like I got to experiment with a lot of different aspects
                of JS. I even got to get into some string formatting to make my extra credit function look extra nice!
                The DOM is also an area of webdev that's a lot clearer to me now, so that is 100% an appreciated skill I got
                to take away from this assignment as well.

            <h1>Assignment 4 - 11/11</h1>
            <p> 
                This was the first assignment where I didn't have prior experience with the material. This made it a little bit harder but within the first
                day or so I nailed down the idea that there was going to need to be a long strand of if-else's. I have worked with web sockets before which have
                the same kind of feel (creating the server, checking the network messages, e.t.c) but that didn't quite translate. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The biggest challenge I faced was the response.end() placement. I had res.end() after every single file read so I my files would just not apply
                after I loaded the first one (index.html). This was very frustrating because I kept commenting out and commenting the statements back in and individually
                they would work but not all together. This was pretty mind-boggling for a little bit. I think the issue came from misinterpreting that res.end() didn't 
                mean that the file was done reading but that it was actually the end of the changes to the page. Now I know why it only read the first file :)
                <br>
                <br>
                The biggest resource that helped me solve this problem was lecture. I skimmed through the lecture recording on Thursday looking for a clue and heard 
                Professor Hess say that res.end() basically says "no more changes to the file." I decided to try moving res.end() to the bottom of the if-else's and
                it worked!
                <br>
                <br>
                The resources I used were mainly lecture this week, and the resources also linked on the website. After hearing that the assignment was meant to be 
                on the shorter side I figured the answers to how to do this specific assignment would be more applicable and I didn't feel the need to do much 
                intensive googling.

            <h1>Assignment 5- 11/24</h1>
            <p> 
                This assignment definitely pushed way deeper into the specific of routing and just generally making things more efficient which is cool but also unfortunately
                when things usually get hard with this kind of thing. I found this assignment to be the hardest out of all the ones we've completed so far. The concept it self 
                was fairly simple conceptually (emphasis on conceptually), building small things out of bigger things makes sense especially in webdev but the execution was 
                very not simple.
                <br>
                <br>
                The biggest challenge I faced was honestly the entire assignment. However, one thing notably stood in my way. I completed part 1 and got the templatized post to add 
                successfully. Then I went on to complete the rest of my steps and so I thought that I was good to go. I tested it and adding the posts just didn't work anymore. So I watched
                the lecture like five times modeled my code exactly after it but still faced issues. The issue ended up being I got it all working and then moved post.handlebars and moved the include
                part of the header and just messed up the routing. Several days of sleep deprived troubleshooting all from a silly file path issue. I guess that's CS though.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like I mentioned above I watched the lectures about a million times to complete this assignment. In addition to that I want to shout out my own skills for helping me with this one, in
                particular the fact that I know that if the code all looks right follows working logic and by all accounts just should work it's probably something simple and deeper than just the lines
                of code (i.e the code is all right you're just routing to a file you moved several days ago before two all nighters).
                <br>
                <br>
                To address what I googled or searched: Literally everything. My searches ranged from just blindly pasting the error code to pleading with the search engine to help me (example: "handlebar code 
                invalid why???""). Ultimately none of it helped. That is why I gave myself a little shout out above. I was really on my own with fixing the issue and I prevailed. Huzzah!
